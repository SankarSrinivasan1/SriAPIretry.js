# SriApiRetry.js

SriApiRetry.js is a JavaScript library that simplifies the implementation of retry logic for API calls. It handles scenarios where API requests may fail due to network issues, server errors, or rate limits, and automatically retries the requests with customizable backoff strategies. By integrating SriApiRetry.js into your application, you can enhance the reliability and resilience of your API interactions.

## Features

- Automatic retry of API requests that fail due to various error conditions.
- Customizable retry options including maximum attempts, backoff strategies, and retryable errors.
- Exponential and linear backoff strategies for delaying retries.
- Simple and straightforward API for making API requests with retry logic.

## Installation

You can install SriApiRetry.js using npm:

```bash
npm install sri-api-retry
```

Alternatively, you can include the library in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="path/to/sri-api-retry.js"></script>
```

## Usage

1. Import or include SriApiRetry.js into your JavaScript file.

```javascript
import SriApiRetry from 'sri-api-retry'; // If using ES modules
```

or

```html
<script src="path/to/sri-api-retry.js"></script> <!-- If including via <script> tag -->
```

2. Create an instance of SriApiRetry with desired options.

```javascript
const apiRetry = new SriApiRetry({
  maxAttempts: 5,
  backoffStrategy: 'exponential',
  retryableErrors: ['500', '502', '503'],
});
```

3. Use the `request` method to make API requests with retry logic.

```javascript
const apiUrl = 'https://example.com/api/endpoint';
const requestOptions = {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
};

apiRetry
  .request(apiUrl, requestOptions)
  .then((response) => {
    console.log('API response:', response);
    // Handle the API response
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('API request failed:', error);
    // Handle the API request failure
  });
```

## Configuration Options

The SriApiRetry constructor accepts an optional `options` object with the following properties:

- `maxAttempts` (number, default: 3): The maximum number of retry attempts for a failed API request.
- `backoffStrategy` (string, default: 'exponential'): The backoff strategy to use for delaying retries. Possible values are 'exponential' or 'linear'.
- `retryableErrors` (array of strings, default: []): An array of error codes or messages that should trigger a retry of the API request.
